   <p> For this project, I built a tool to visually compare the distances (straight and driving) of hospital locations to the borders of neighbouring counties. The context for this study was a change in health policy that affected certain hospitals' eligibility for reimbursement at rural rates. 
   While examining effects of this policy, the client needed a report on the counties closest to a set of providers. This tool was built to let them easily explore the results. For privacy reasons, the actual hospitals and comparison counties have been changed in this published version. 
   </p>

   <h3><a name="Thoughts" class="anchor" href="#thoughts"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Thoughts about Project</h3>
   <p> This tool wasn't necessary or required to complete the task, but was a nice way to let the client understand the methodology, and to be able to explore any unexpected results. It was useful in conveying the effect of selecting between straight or driving distances.

   <p> I was pleased in doing this work to learn about: 
      <ul>
      <li>Topojson manipulation</li>
      <li>Sampling points along SVG paths</li>
      <li>Geographic projection</li>
      <li>Clip-Path, and</li>
      <li>Thinking about navigation, visual cues</li>
      </ul>
